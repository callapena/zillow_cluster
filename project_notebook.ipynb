    "# Zillow Project - Predict Zestimate (logerror)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a model to predict Zestimate (logerror)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I.D. what is driving the Zestimate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planning\n",
    "Pipeline:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   1. ***Aquire*** - Create a sql query that will connect to zillow database. The query will pull data for properties that were sold in 2017, and their Zestimate. The dataframe aquired will give us features to evaluate how they effect the Zestimate target variable.\n",
    "   2. ***Prep*** - Clean NaN values with imputing, and setting qualifying properties for columns and rows with proportions that must be filled. Rename columns to be short and easy to use names. Put features in to proper numeric and catagorical data types. Scale features to be used in explore\n",
    "   3. ***Explore*** - Split prepped dataframe into train and test. Use clustering to find out how different properties, are distributed in the zestimate target. Use statistical tests to find how properties in the dataset are simalar or different. Create new features from dataset, that can give more insight into what influences the value of properites. Find top features that drive Zestimate to create predictive Model\n",
    "   4. ***Model*** - Create predictive models with features evaluated in explore phase. Evaluate models to find closest predictive error to the actual Zestimate."
